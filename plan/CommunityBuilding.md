## Attention Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch (Month 1-2)

#### 1. Initial Content Creation

**Goal**: Establish credibility through quality content

**Actions**:
- ✅ Create comprehensive PHILOSOPHY.md template
- ✅ Research 20+ thought leaders with detailed profiles
- ✅ Write integration guides for major AI tools
- ✅ Create value proposition documentation
- ✅ Develop example projects

**Deliverables**:
- GitHub repository with:
  - README.md (compelling overview)
  - PHILOSOPHY.md (example/template)
  - research/ (20+ thought leader files)
  - examples/ (3-5 example projects)
  - integrations/ (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Aider guides)

---

#### 2. Strategic Launches

**A. GitHub Launch**

**Pre-launch**:
- Polish README with compelling hook
- Add badges, screenshots, examples
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md
- Set up GitHub Discussions
- Prepare launch announcement

**Launch Day**:
- Submit to GitHub Trending
- Post on personal/company social media
- Share in relevant Slack/Discord communities
- Email developer newsletter authors

**Post-launch**:
- Respond to all comments/questions quickly
- Create issues for community feedback
- Start GitHub Discussions on philosophy topics

**B. Hacker News Launch**

**Title**: "Philosophy.md: Document the 'Why' Behind Your Code for AI Assistants"

**Post Content**:
```
I built Philosophy.md to solve a problem I kept hitting: AI coding assistants
generate correct code, but they don't know *why* we make certain architectural
decisions.

Existing config tools (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md) focus on *how*
(commands, conventions). Philosophy.md fills the *why* gap: principles,
trade-offs, design rationale.

Key features:
- Documents coding philosophy and design rationale
- Integrates with Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider
- Research files on thought leaders (Fowler, Beck, Martin, etc.)
- Templates and examples to get started

Repo: https://github.com/[username]/Philosophy.md

Would love feedback from the community!
```

**Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM PT (optimal HN posting time)

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to every comment thoughtfully
- Provide examples when asked
- Acknowledge valid criticisms
- Invite contributions

**C. Reddit Launch**

**Subreddits** (in order):
1. r/programming (most visibility)
2. r/ExperiencedDevs (target audience)
3. r/github (tool integration focus)
4. r/ArtificialIntelligence (AI coding assistant angle)
5. r/coding (beginner-friendly)

**Post Template**:
```
Title: [Show] Philosophy.md: Document Your Coding Philosophy for AI Assistants

I created Philosophy.md to bridge a gap I noticed in AI-assisted development.

**The Problem**: AI tools generate working code but don't understand your
project's philosophical principles - the "why" behind architectural decisions.

**The Solution**: PHILOSOPHY.md documents:
- Design principles and rationale
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Pattern preferences with explanations
- Thought leader influences (Fowler, Beck, Martin)

Works with: GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider

GitHub: [link]

I'd love your feedback!

```

**D. Dev.to / Medium Launch**

**Article Title**: "Why Your AI Coding Assistant Needs PHILOSOPHY.md (Not Just AGENTS.md)"

**Outline**:
1. The Problem: AI generates code without understanding "why"
2. Current Solutions: AGENTS.md, .cursorrules - focus on "how"
3. The Gap: No documentation of principles, rationale, trade-offs
4. The Solution: PHILOSOPHY.md
5. Real Examples: Before/After AI suggestions
6. Integration: How it works with tools
7. Getting Started: Template and examples
8. Call to Action: Try it, contribute

**Distribution**:

## Interest Generation Strategy

### 1. Value Demonstration

**Before/After Examples**:

**Scenario**: Feature implementation request

**Without Philosophy.md**:
```
Developer: "Add user authentication"

AI (generic): "I'll create a basic auth system with username/password"
[Generates simple but non-architectural code]

Developer: "No, we use hexagonal architecture"

AI: "I'll refactor..."
[Multiple iterations to align]
```

**With Philosophy.md**:
```
Developer: "Add user authentication"

AI (with philosophy): "Based on PHILOSOPHY.md#architecture, I'll use
hexagonal architecture with ports and adapters. Following
PHILOSOPHY.md#testing, I'll start with tests."

[Generates architecture-aligned code on first try]
```

**ROI Calculator**:
- Time saved per feature: X hours
- Reduced code review cycles: Y%
- Faster onboarding: Z weeks
- **Calculate total savings**: Interactive web calculator

---

### 2. Social Proof

**Case Studies**:

**Startup Example**:
```
"Philosophy.md reduced our code review time by 30% and new developers
are productive in 2 weeks instead of 2 months."
- CTO, Series A Startup
```

**Open Source Example**:
```
"After adding PHILOSOPHY.md, our contributor PR quality doubled and
maintainer review time was cut in half."
- Maintainer, Popular OSS Project
```

**Enterprise Example**:
```
"Philosophy.md enabled us to scale our philosophy across 100+
developers consistently. AI-generated code now aligns with our
standards 90% of the time."
- VP Engineering, Enterprise SaaS Company
```

- **Risk**: Too many tools to support
- **Mitigation**: AGENTS.md as universal standard, tool-agnostic philosophy
- **Backup Plan**: Focus on top 3 tools initially

**3. Contributor Burnout**
- **Risk**: Maintainers overwhelmed
- **Mitigation**: Clear contribution guidelines, automated reviews, core team growth
- **Backup Plan**: Reduce scope, focus on quality over quantity

**4. Philosophy Bikeshedding**
- **Risk**: Endless debates on what constitutes "philosophy"
