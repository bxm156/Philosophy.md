### `/philosophy:create`

Create a custom philosophy through an interactive interview.

```bash
/philosophy:create
```

**Process:**

1. **Select 2-4 philosophies** to blend (e.g., "John Carmack, TDD, Python")
2. **Answer interview questions** about your preferences:
   - Testing approach
   - Performance vs simplicity tradeoffs
   - Code style preferences
   - Development approach
3. **Get a custom blended philosophy** saved to `PHILOSOPHY.md`

**Example Output:**

```markdown
# Custom Philosophy: Test-Driven Performance with Pragmatic Python

This philosophy blends:
- 40% Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- 35% John Carmack's Performance Philosophy
- 25% Python's Zen

## Core Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Performance
Write tests first, but profile and optimize bottlenecks ruthlessly...
```

## What Gets Created

After running `/philosophy:install` or `/philosophy:create`, you'll have:

```text
your-project/
├── PHILOSOPHY.md          # ✅ Your coding philosophy
├── src/
├── tests/
└── ...
```

The philosophy file stays in your project root, providing guidance whenever you need it.

## Example Workflows

### Quick Start with a Pre-Made Philosophy

```bash
# Browse options
/philosophy:list

# Install TDD philosophy
/philosophy:install tdd

# Start coding with TDD principles!
```

### Create a Custom Blend

```bash
# Start the interview
/philosophy:create

# Select philosophies
> John Carmack, TDD, Python

# Answer questions
Q: How do you prefer to test code?
A: Write tests first (TDD)

Q: When there's a tradeoff between performance and simplicity:
A: Balanced - profile then optimize

# Get your custom philosophy
✅ Custom philosophy created and saved to PHILOSOPHY.md!
```

### Switch Philosophies

```bash
# Try a different philosophy
/philosophy:install martin_fowler

# Your PHILOSOPHY.md is now updated to Martin Fowler's approach
```

## Philosophy Sources

All philosophies are sourced from:

- Public writings and talks by the developers
- Official language documentation (PEPs, RFCs, etc.)
- Widely-accepted best practices and methodologies
- Historical context and real-world impact

Each philosophy includes:

- Overview and background
- Core principles with examples
- Practices and patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Key resources and references

## Use Cases

- **Personal Development**: Adopt proven practices from industry legends
- **Team Alignment**: Establish shared coding values and standards
- **Learning**: Study different approaches to software development
- **Decision Making**: Reference philosophy when making architectural choices
- **Code Reviews**: Use philosophy as objective criteria for feedback
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand project values

## Known Limitations

### Script Execution Constraint

**Current Status**: This plugin currently does not execute external scripts from commands.

**Why this matters**: There's an [open issue in Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9354) where the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable doesn't work in command markdown files (only in JSON configurations). This prevents plugins from executing bundled helper scripts.

**Impact on Philosophy.md**:

- ✅ All current v1.0.0 commands work perfectly (they're prompt-based)
- ⚠️ Future features requiring script execution are blocked:
  - Philosophy compliance validation
  - Automated pre-commit hooks
  - Code analysis and stack detection
  - Configuration file modifications

**Tracking**: We're monitoring [anthropics/claude-code#9354](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9354) for resolution. Once fixed, we'll unlock advanced features listed in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

**Workaround**: For advanced users who need scripting now, Claude Code Skills can provide some capabilities, though it's not ideal for plugin distribution.

## Future Enhancements

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned features:

- CLAUDE.md integration for AI-powered guidance
- Project-specific application and tooling integration
- Pre-commit hooks and philosophy enforcement
- Team collaboration features
- Community philosophy sharing
- And much more!

**Note**: Some advanced features depend on the resolution of the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` limitation above.
