## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive philosophy documentation organized into three categories:

1. **People** - Coding philosophies from influential software developers and thought leaders
2. **Languages** - Design philosophies and principles of programming languages
3. **Methodologies** - Software development approaches and practices

Each philosophy file provides:
- Core principles and rationale
- Practical code examples
- Trade-offs and considerations
- Application guidelines
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Key resources and references

## How to Use These Philosophies

### For Individual Developers

**Learning**:
1. Start with one philosophy that resonates with you
2. Read the principles and examples
3. Try applying in small projects
4. Gradually incorporate into daily practice

**Reference**:
- Before starting a feature: "What philosophy applies here?"
- During code review: "Does this align with our philosophy?"
- When refactoring: "How would [philosopher] approach this?"

### For Teams

**Adoption**:
1. Choose 1-2 primary philosophies for your project
2. Document in `PHILOSOPHY.md`
3. Reference in code reviews
4. Teach in onboarding

### Integration with AI Tools

Reference philosophies in your AI tool configuration:
- `AGENTS.md`: "See philosophies/CLEAN_CODE.PHILOSOPHY.md"
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/rules/`
- Aider via helper scripts
