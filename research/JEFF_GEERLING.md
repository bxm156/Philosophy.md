## Programming Philosophy

### Infrastructure as Code

**Philosophy**: Treat infrastructure the same way you treat application code—version controlled, tested, and automated.

**Key Principles**:
- Repeatability: Same configuration every time
- Version control: Track all changes
- Testing: Validate infrastructure changes
- Documentation as code: Configuration is self-documenting

**Quote from book**: "Ansible was built by developers and sysadmins who want to make a tool that helps them manage their servers exactly the same as they have in the past, but in a repeatable and centrally managed way."

**Source**: [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)

### Accessibility and Education

**Philosophy**: Technical knowledge should be accessible to everyone, not just experts.

**Approach**:
- Clear, jargon-free explanations
- Practical, hands-on examples
- Free educational content alongside paid books
- Community engagement and support

**Teaching principle**: "To be able to teach well, you not only have to know how to do, you have to know why you do, how not to do, and the entire history of whatever task is being done."

**Source**: [Wikitubia - Jeff Geerling](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_Geerling)

### Open Source First

**Philosophy**: Develop in the open and share knowledge freely.

**Practice**:
- Nearly all code developed in public repositories
- Documentation and examples freely available
- YouTube channel for visual learning
- Blog posts sharing knowledge and experiences
- Manuscript for "Ansible for DevOps" is open source

**Personal statement**: "Since he started his work in computing, he loved the open source philosophy, and he develops almost every line of code in the open, with his YouTube repository being an extension of that philosophy."

**Source**: [Open Source Agenda - Geerlingguy YouTube](https://www.opensourceagenda.com/projects/geerlingguy-youtube)

### Pragmatism Over Perfectionism

**Philosophy**: Ship working solutions, iterate and improve.

**Application**:
- Start with functional automation
- Refine based on real-world feedback
- Balance ideal architecture with practical needs
- Share imperfect work to help others learn

## Career Philosophy

### Passion Over Profit

In early 2021, Geerling made a significant career decision:
- Quit lucrative software development career
- More than halved his annual income
- Focus on books, blog, open source, and videos
- Prioritize teaching and community contribution

**Motivation**: Freedom to create educational content and contribute to open source on his own terms.

**Reality check**: "With his YouTube channel, he can teach in ways many teachers never could, to new global audiences. However, he acknowledges he's not always teaching and also has to entertain, earn a paycheck, and support his family."

### Community Engagement

**Philosophy**: Engage with community, respond to feedback, iterate based on real-world use.

**Practice**:
- Active on social media (Twitter/X: @geerlingguy)
- Responsive to GitHub issues and pull requests
- Incorporates reader and viewer feedback
- Regular book updates based on technology changes

## Technical Philosophy

### Simplicity and Clarity

**Approach**:
- Ansible YAML over complex scripting
- Clear variable naming
- Documented playbooks and roles
- Idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)

**Benefit**: Infrastructure everyone on team can understand and maintain.

### Automation for Humans

**Philosophy**: Automation should make sysadmins and developers' lives easier, not more complex.

**Key aspects**:
- Human-readable YAML configuration
- Logical organization and structure
- Clear error messages
- Gradual learning curve

### Testing and Validation

**Philosophy**: Test infrastructure changes before production.

**Practice**:
- Use Molecule for testing Ansible roles
- CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure code
- Validation before deployment
- Idempotent playbooks allow safe re-runs
