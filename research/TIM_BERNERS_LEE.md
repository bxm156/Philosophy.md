## Major Contributions

### The World Wide Web (1989)

While working at CERN in 1989, Berners-Lee proposed and implemented the World Wide Web:

### Made It Free

**Critical decision**: Berners-Lee made the Web available freely, with no patent and no royalties.

**Philosophy**: "Openness of information has remained Berners-Lee's guiding principle - he never took steps to gain intellectual property or other commercial rights over the Web."

**Impact**: Enabled explosive growth of the Web, prevented single company control, benefited all humanity.

### World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, 1994)

Founded W3C to develop Web standards:
- Open standards development
- Royalty-free specifications
- Consensus-based decision making
- Universal access principles

**Goal**: "Lead the Web to its full potential" through interoperable technologies.

### Solid Platform (2016)

Developed Solid (Social Linked Data) to restore Web's original vision:
- Decentralized data storage
- User control of personal data
- Data portability between applications
- Privacy by design

**Philosophy**: Combat surveillance capitalism, return control to users.

## Web Design Philosophy

### Simplicity

**Core principle**: "Keep it simple"

**Quote**: "His minimalist Web-design philosophy is the same as his minimalist life philosophy: Keep it simple."

**Implementation**:
- Simple protocols (HTTP)
- Simple markup (HTML)
- Simple addressing (URLs)
- Build complexity from simple foundations

### Universality

**Philosophy**: The Web should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, on any device.

**Principles**:
- Platform independence
- Device independence
- No proprietary lock-in
- Works for people with disabilities

**Quote**: "The navigation of the Web has to be open. If the day comes when you need six browsers on your machine, the World Wide Web will no longer be the World Wide Web."

### Decentralization

**Original vision**: Web as decentralized medium for information exchange

**Key concepts**:
- No central control point
- Distributed architecture
- Peer-to-peer design
- User autonomy

**Solid project**: Attempt to restore this vision against centralization by tech giants.

## Core Philosophical Principles

### Open Standards

**Philosophy**: Web standards should be:
- Royalty-free
- Developed openly
- Consensus-based
- Implementable by anyone

**W3C decision**: Standards based on royalty-free technology

**Impact**: Prevented patent wars, enabled wide implementation, fostered innovation.

### Privacy and User Control

**Belief**: "Personal empowerment through technology" must be protected against corporate centralization and surveillance capitalism.

**Solid approach**:
- Users own their data
- Data stored in personal "Pods"
- Applications request access
- Users grant/revoke permissions

**Goal**: Shift power from corporations to individuals.

### Idealism Over Commercialization

**Philosophy**: Technology should serve humanity, not just profit.

**Actions**:
- Refused offers to commercialize the Web
- Made Web freely available
- Fought against proprietary control
- Advocated for digital rights

**Quote**: "He remained an idealist and refused all offers, instead making the Web available to all."

## Current Concerns and Advocacy

### Fighting Centralization

**Problem**: Web dominated by few large platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon)

**Concern**: Original decentralized vision compromised

**Solution**: Solid platform to restore user control

### Combating Surveillance Capitalism

**Issue**: Business models based on tracking users and selling data

**Position**: Users should control their own data

**Approach**: Build technology that enables user sovereignty

### Net Neutrality

**Advocacy**: Equal treatment for all Web traffic

**Philosophy**: Open Web requires neutral infrastructure

**Action**: Public advocacy and technical solutions

## Impact on Software Development

### Web Standards

Berners-Lee's work established:
- Standards-based development
- Interoperability requirements
- Backward compatibility importance
- Open specification processes

### Distributed Systems

WWW demonstrated:
- Global-scale distributed systems work
- Decentralization enables resilience
- Simple protocols scale
- Stateless design benefits

### API Design
